It produces over twice as much thrust as the Saturn V that took humans to the moon. The goal of the test is to get further along than IFT-2 in April 20th which didn't make it to stage separation while also hoping the improvements to the launch pad hold up better than the previous attempt. If all goes well, Starship will re-enter near Hawaii about 90 minutes after it lifts off from Starbase, TX, nearly completing an orbit of the Earth. This would allow the teams to test the reentry profile and heat shields for the first time from orbital velocities. Want more information?

Ahead of the launch, SpaceX will close the road, evacuate the village and surrounding area, and clear the potential blast radius.

Our original plan was to complete a full lap of Australia and return home to Perth to resume our 'normal' lives. We decided we wanted to document our lap for the future and began sharing weekly travel vlogs of our life on the road and fell in love vlogging, filmmaking and sharing our lives with you. We completed our first lap and couldn't imagine living any other way so we decided to continue travelling and calling the Troopy home. We have gone on some crazy adventures since then and it is all thanks to you tuning in to join us every week.",Travel & Events

In Japan she is called an Okami, the head lady in charge of the restaurant, in this case a Japanese Izakaya.  This is the typical day of a Japanese night worker or a Japanese person who works all night at an all-night restaurant in Tokyo. She works at Ginza Karin, an all-night Izakaya restaurant that offers traditional home-style Japanese cuisine with a wide selection of alcohol in one the most opulent areas of Tokyo, Ginza. She built this shop from nothing and now she‚Äôs serves as the Okami.  The early-shift workers start the prep beforehand, just in time so she can check the dishes when she arrives, ensuring that each dish created meet the high quality standards she‚Äôs put in place. Her restaurant is located in the heart of the Ginza 7 chome / 8 chome district, renowned for its abundance of Japanese hostess clubs, with many of the hostesses in the area either wearing dresses or Kimonos just like Yuka. The Izakaya serves Obanzai, which are everyday Japanese side dishes made with seasonal ingredients, originating from traditional Kyoto-style home cooking.  The dishes are usually served in large bowls lined up on the shop‚Äôs countertop for customers to able to see and choose. We follow her from her morning routine all the way until the end of her work night.

After a mere eight minutes of FP1, the session was red-flagged and eventually the Vegas GP practice (FP1) cancelled due to a safety issue. This caused massive delays throughout the night and caused Vegas FP2 delays!Carlos Sainz was the victom of the Vegas manhole cover, hitting it at high speed and causing significant damage to his Ferrari. The impact was so severe that it cracked his chassis, requiring a replacement. As a result of the incident the FIA decided on a Carlos Sainz grid penalty.These Vegas GP delays left F1 fans unhappy with the situation, many of whom had paid top dollar for tickets to the event. Prior to the Las Vegas FP2, a majority of F1 fans forced to leave the track early as well - missing out on alsmot all the track action.#f1 #f12023 #f1lasvegas #lasvegasgp #vegasgp To find out more about how a Manhole ruins Vegas F1, watch the full video now!Purchase a hand-signed F1 driver print here: https://www.kymillman.com/signed-f1-driver-photos/?v=635f407d621deBecome a channel member and receive monthly free wallpapers, RAW image files after each race, Exclusive videos and discounts at my store.

(and other games sometimes too). Explaining everything there is to explain! Why is each Pokemon given the type it has? What are their origins? What is the lore of the Pokemon world and the design inspirations? And what does it all have to do with alchemy? Let's Go find out!Bonus deleted scenes for the bottom of the description!     One joke I wrote but Jeremy (rightfully) cut was Eevee finding a Waterstone, looking at it with vehement disgust, and then moving on... if you know you know.           Serperior and Quaquaval originally had a much more intense... binding moment... it was reduced to under a second for your sake... I, I really don't know what was going on with me while writing this one...You'll notice there's a semi-secret second Eevee at the end of the Eeveeloutions scene. Earlier drafts of this royale feature multiple copies of some of the starters, such as Partner Pikachu AND regular Pikachu from Yellow, or 2 different Rowlets for example, one for Sun and Moon, and one for Legends Arceus. The semi-secret second Eevee has a Katana, it's the Eevee from Conquest specifically, it was left as just a small visual gag/nod to that. Also at one point, I considered including the many starter Pokemon from Pokemon Battle Revolution too, but ultimately that would add too many Pokemon that most people would just be confused by... So we left it to the main game's Starter Pokemon.",Gaming

With a Melted VG30DETT and clean paint this was a perfect donor for a stupid engine conversion. Originally Al went down the path of bolting on a pair of G25-900's to a Nissan VH41DE 4.1L Alloy V8 but as the months went past lost interest in the project due to the complexity of the build. A few engine conversion ideas were floated around including a DCT backed Honda K24, Turbo VW VR6 or even just a stout VG30 but in the end Alan landed on the path of building a RB25/30.With the help from some epic companies like@haltechHaltech, Go Fast Bits, Raceworks, Golebys Parts and Supercheap Auto this vision is coming to life and AL's Dream 300ZX will soon be a reality!

But a lot of matter in the universe exists outside this narrow band of relatively low temperatures and pressures. Inside planets and stars, the crushing force of gravity begins to overwhelm the electromagnetic and nuclear forces that keep atoms apart and maintain the shapes of molecules. What happens next? Scientists (including a consortia of researchers at the NSF‚Äôs Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures‚Äã‚Äã) are just starting to figure that out. They use a variety of tools (including some humongous lasers) to simulate planetary cores and see what happens. A few standout findings so far:Water can become a hot black ice that conducts electricity: https://www.quantamagazine.org/black-hot-superionic-ice-may-be-natures-most-common-form-of-water-20190508/Hydrogen gas can be compressed down into a shiny metal: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2119442-metallic-hydrogen-finally-made-in-lab-at-mind-boggling-pressure/Sodium (a soft, silvery metal at atmospheric pressure) can turn transparent: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090312180838.htmPresented by the Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures (CMAP) at the University of Rochester,a National Science Foundation (NSF) Physics Frontier Center, Award PHY-2020249 https://cmap.rochester.edu/What happens under extreme pressures deep with planets also influences their ability to foster life.

And that‚Äôs likely to be true for the first race on the new circuit in Las Vegas. It‚Äôs fast, it‚Äôs a street track and the race starts at 10pm local time. But the biggest challenge for the teams is that at that time, it‚Äôs going to be cold‚Ä¶ really cold. So, why is the drastically colder than usual temperature such an issue? What are the teams and drivers going to do about it? And are we going to see an incredibly chaotic race?Formula One cars really don‚Äôt work well at cold temperatures. Now, this is counterintuitive. You might notice that all of the fastest laps at your local kart track were set in the evening or at night. But in F1, the power units and in particular, the tyres just aren‚Äôt made to work when temperatures are below about 15 degrees celsius. And you might ask, why? Well, the vast majority of the season is within a fairly tight temperature band, within the mid to high 20 degrees C range - and it has been for a while. üìπ All source footage can be found here üëâ https://bit.ly/3QYhEoB ‚û§Follow Driver61 on:   ‚û§ Instagram- @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta   ‚û§TikTok - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61TikTok‚û§ Follow Scott on:   ‚û§ Twitter - https://twitter.com/scottkmansell   ‚û§ Instagram - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta#Formula1 #LasVegasGP #F1",Autos & Vehicles

Pre-order now: https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-for-rent-expansion-pack  There‚Äôs a new way for Sims to generate income ‚Äì by investing in Residential Rentals. As a property owner your Sim can live among their tenants and be a hands-on property manager, or they can live away from their investment in a separate residence. But don‚Äôt let them get passive about this income stream! Property owners will have to keep their unit ratings high through regular maintenance or they could wind up dealing with a Tenant Revolt. Residential Rentals are more than just a way for savvy Sims to make Simoleons; they‚Äôre a way to bring communities together and tell new kinds of stories. Maybe your Sim is starting fresh in a basement suite, or maybe two young Sims become sweethearts after growing up in different units of the same duplex. You can now divide lots into multiple units, which creates new possibilities for what you can build. It also means different families will be living on the same lot and have plenty of chances to interact with each other. Your Sims can bond with their neighbors, chatting by the mailboxes in their apartment building or enjoying food together at a potluck. Or, they can seize the opportunity to dig up dirt on everyone around them. Eavesdropping, snooping, and breaking into their neighbors units are all on the table.
