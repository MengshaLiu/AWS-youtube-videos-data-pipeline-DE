So, I found something... a few months ago, while we were trying to film a video where I let TikTok ads pick my outfits, I stumbled upon... this dress. It goes by a few names but it's most commonly some version of the floral midriff shaper corset sundress - and after buying one for the video, my for you page started getting flooded with TONS of ads for what looked like the same dress - but all from different companies, and with wildly different price points. So, I decided - let's buy a few of these bad boys and see what actually ends up at our doorstep - and find out, what the heck IS up. Where are all these dresses coming from? Are they all the same dress? Clearly someone is lying here - but who? I guess we'll find out...This video is NOT sponsored!!

It produces over twice as much thrust as the Saturn V that took humans to the moon. The goal of the test is to get further along than IFT-2 in April 20th which didn't make it to stage separation while also hoping the improvements to the launch pad hold up better than the previous attempt. If all goes well, Starship will re-enter near Hawaii about 90 minutes after it lifts off from Starbase, TX, nearly completing an orbit of the Earth. This would allow the teams to test the reentry profile and heat shields for the first time from orbital velocities. Want more information?

Our original plan was to complete a full lap of Australia and return home to Perth to resume our 'normal' lives. We decided we wanted to document our lap for the future and began sharing weekly travel vlogs of our life on the road and fell in love vlogging, filmmaking and sharing our lives with you. We completed our first lap and couldn't imagine living any other way so we decided to continue travelling and calling the Troopy home. We have gone on some crazy adventures since then and it is all thanks to you tuning in to join us every week.",Travel & Events
