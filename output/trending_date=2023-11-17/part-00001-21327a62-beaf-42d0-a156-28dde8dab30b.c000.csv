(and other games sometimes too). Explaining everything there is to explain! Why is each Pokemon given the type it has? What are their origins? What is the lore of the Pokemon world and the design inspirations? And what does it all have to do with alchemy? Let's Go find out!Bonus deleted scenes for the bottom of the description!     One joke I wrote but Jeremy (rightfully) cut was Eevee finding a Waterstone, looking at it with vehement disgust, and then moving on... if you know you know.           Serperior and Quaquaval originally had a much more intense... binding moment... it was reduced to under a second for your sake... I, I really don't know what was going on with me while writing this one...You'll notice there's a semi-secret second Eevee at the end of the Eeveeloutions scene. Earlier drafts of this royale feature multiple copies of some of the starters, such as Partner Pikachu AND regular Pikachu from Yellow, or 2 different Rowlets for example, one for Sun and Moon, and one for Legends Arceus. The semi-secret second Eevee has a Katana, it's the Eevee from Conquest specifically, it was left as just a small visual gag/nod to that. Also at one point, I considered including the many starter Pokemon from Pokemon Battle Revolution too, but ultimately that would add too many Pokemon that most people would just be confused by... So we left it to the main game's Starter Pokemon.",Gaming

With a Melted VG30DETT and clean paint this was a perfect donor for a stupid engine conversion. Originally Al went down the path of bolting on a pair of G25-900's to a Nissan VH41DE 4.1L Alloy V8 but as the months went past lost interest in the project due to the complexity of the build. A few engine conversion ideas were floated around including a DCT backed Honda K24, Turbo VW VR6 or even just a stout VG30 but in the end Alan landed on the path of building a RB25/30.With the help from some epic companies like@haltechHaltech, Go Fast Bits, Raceworks, Golebys Parts and Supercheap Auto this vision is coming to life and AL's Dream 300ZX will soon be a reality!

And that’s likely to be true for the first race on the new circuit in Las Vegas. It’s fast, it’s a street track and the race starts at 10pm local time. But the biggest challenge for the teams is that at that time, it’s going to be cold… really cold. So, why is the drastically colder than usual temperature such an issue? What are the teams and drivers going to do about it? And are we going to see an incredibly chaotic race?Formula One cars really don’t work well at cold temperatures. Now, this is counterintuitive. You might notice that all of the fastest laps at your local kart track were set in the evening or at night. But in F1, the power units and in particular, the tyres just aren’t made to work when temperatures are below about 15 degrees celsius. And you might ask, why? Well, the vast majority of the season is within a fairly tight temperature band, within the mid to high 20 degrees C range - and it has been for a while. 📹 All source footage can be found here 👉 https://bit.ly/3QYhEoB ➤Follow Driver61 on:   ➤ Instagram- @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta   ➤TikTok - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61TikTok➤ Follow Scott on:   ➤ Twitter - https://twitter.com/scottkmansell   ➤ Instagram - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta#Formula1 #LasVegasGP #F1",Autos & Vehicles

According to director Kelsey Mann, the new character promises to stir things up within headquarters. “Anxiety, voiced by Maya Hawke, might be new to the crew, but she’s not really the type to take a back seat,” said Mann. “That makes a lot of sense if you think about it in terms of what goes on inside all our minds.” A trailer, poster and film stills are now available for what promises to be the feel-good (or feel-everything) film of Summer 2024. Disney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who’ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren’t sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she’s not alone. Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust. Directed by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, “Inside Out 2” releases only in theaters Summer 2024.",Film & Animation

It has 1016bhp. It has double the downforce of the regular SF90. It’s also lighter. It does 0-62mph in 2.3secs. But there’s one main thing that absolutely sets this XX apart from all the others. It’s road legal. The first ever XX car to be able to drive, well, anywhere you like really.But what about its track credentials? It happened to lap Fiorano in 1.17.3, making it Ferrari’s fastest-ever road car around their home circuit, 1.7 seconds ahead of the SF90.In total 1398 cars are being built, split between 799 Stradales (at £673,584 a pop) and 599 Spiders (each £730,000). A quick reminder that a base SF90 is £376k.Top Gear Magazine’s Head of Car Testing, Ollie Marriage, had the tough job of seeing what it’s like to drive.Subscribe to Top Gear for more videos: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGearWATCH MORE TOP GEAR:First Looks: https://bit.ly/TGFirstLooks First Drives: https://bit.ly/TGFirstDrivesAmerican Tuned ft.

SpaceX launched its first batch of Starlink satellites back in 2019, and since then, adoption of the service has ballooned. Starlink now has over 2 million active customers and is available on all 7 continents and in over 60 countries. Starlink has been praised for its ability to connect remote parts of the world that would otherwise not have access to reliable internet. The service has also become indispensable in areas hit by natural disasters, and, more recently, during times of war, particularly the Russia-Ukraine war. But Starlink’s growing influence is garnering condemnation from some who say that SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk is meddling in geopolitics, while the scientific community is raising alarms of the effect of thousands of satellites on radio and optical astronomy.Chapters:00:00 - 03:03 Intro03:03 - 06:36 Behind Starlink’s growth06:36 - 10:33 Starlink and geopolitics10:33 - 15:35 Scientific concerns15:35 - 18:38 FutureProduced and Edited by: Magdalena PetrovaAnimation: Mallory BranganSupervising Producer: Jeniece PettittEditorial Support: Michael SheetzAdditional Footage: Getty Images» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevisionAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

New student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is welcomed into the top of the social food chain by the elite group of popular girls called “The Plastics,” ruled by the conniving queen bee Regina George (Reneé Rapp) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika). However, when Cady makes the major misstep of falling for Regina’s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), she finds herself prey in Regina’s crosshairs. As Cady sets to take down the group’s apex predator with the help of her outcast friends Janis (Auli’i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she must learn how to stay true to herself while navigating the most cutthroat jungle of all: high school.Connect with #MeanGirls online:Official Site: https://meangirls.comTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@meangirlsInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/meangirls/Twitter: https://twitter.com/MeanGirlsFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/meangirls/Sign up for EXCLUSIVE content & updates: https://www.meangirls.com/signup/Paramount Pictures Corporation (PPC), a major global producer and distributor of filmed entertainment, is a unit of Viacom (NASDAQ: VIAB, VIA), home to premier global media brands that create compelling television programs, motion pictures, short-form content, apps, games, consumer products, social media experiences, and other entertainment content for audiences in more than 180 countries.

Craft the everyday food, fuel, weapons, ammo and space suit upgrades you’ll need to survive out here in the vastness of the cosmos.In space there is no up or down! Expand your base in any direction for the most efficient layout. Once you are equipped with the necessary fuel and a warp drive, you’ll be free to explore other sectors and continue your mission.Circumnavigate tiny asteroids, fly between abandoned outposts, and board derelict spaceships as they orbit the system. Take caution, however, and remember to keep your jetpack fuel topped up–you’ll need it to get back to your Space Rig safe and sound!Each salvage zone is a procedurally generated, dynamic, and ever-changing open world.You are an employee for the galaxy’s number one waste disposal firm, stranded far away from home with a mission to clean the galaxy from the remains of a galactic war.Space trash is your main resource. Whether it is salvaged debris floating in space, advanced and rare tech from wrecked ships, or scavenged goods from asteroid surfaces, you’ll want to snatch it all up!Recycle and refine it to produce valuable goods that will net a tidy sum on the Trash Exchange, and spend it to upgrade your kit.You’re not alone amid the wreckage. Alien bots patrol most sectors of space nowadays and they’ll be drawn to you as your operation expands.You’ll need a steady aim, impeccable defenses, and an upgraded armory to protect your Space Rig from the dangers of these foes.

I'm 28 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up.

The 9-part series event premieres January 26. https://apple.co/_MastersOfTheAirFrom Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman - the producers of Band of Brothers and The Pacific. During World War II, airmen risk their lives with the 100th Bomb Group, a brotherhood forged by courage, loss, and triumph.Based on Donald L. Miller’s book of the same name, and scripted by John Orloff, “Masters of the Air” follows the men of the 100th Bomb Group (the “Bloody Hundredth”) as they conduct perilous bombing raids over Nazi Germany and grapple with the frigid conditions, lack of oxygen, and sheer terror of combat conducted at 25,000 feet in the air. Portraying the psychological and emotional price paid by these young men as they helped destroy the horror of Hitler’s Third Reich, is at the heart of “Masters of the Air.” Some were shot down and captured; some were wounded or killed. And some were lucky enough to make it home. Regardless of individual fate, a toll was exacted on them all.The series features a stellar cast led by Academy Award nominee Austin Butler, Callum Turner, Anthony Boyle and Nate Mann, who are joined by Raff Law, Academy Award nominee Barry Keoghan, Josiah Cross, Branden Cook and Ncuti Gatwa.Hailing from Apple Studios, Masters of the Air is executive produced by Steven Spielberg through Amblin Television, and Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman for Playtone. Amblin Television’s Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey co-executive produce alongside Playtone’s Steven Shareshian. In addition to writing, Orloff co-executive produces. Graham Yost also serves as co-executive producer. Anna Boden, Ryan Fleck, Cary Joji Fukunaga, Dee Rees and Tim Van Patten serve as directors.Subscribe to Apple TV’s YouTube channel: https://apple.co/AppleTVYouTubeFollow Apple TV:Instagram: https://instagram.com/AppleTVFacebook: https://facebook.com/AppleTVTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleTVGiphy: https://giphy.com/AppleTVFollow Apple Films:Instagram: https://instagram.com/AppleFilmsTwitter: https://twitter.com/AppleFilmsMore from Apple TV: https://apple.co/32qgOEJApple TV+ is a streaming service with original stories from the most creative minds in TV and film.

We also now know how this sets up the future of the MCu and a rough idea of where it could all be going for the upcoming films. I won't be covering The Marvels ending incase you haven't seen it but later on we might give some theories for Deadpool 3 and Avengers Secret Wars.That will all be at the end of the video though and last week saw Loki getting the band back together to travel back to the loom in order to stop it from self destructing.That takes us into this episode in which we get a lot of major revelations. For that final time I'm gonna need you to hit the thumbs up button and don't forget to subscribe because we still have a lot of comic content coming soon. With that out the way, huge thank you for clicking this, now let's get into The Loki Season 2 Finale.-Now as always we begin with the marvel studios logo however here somethings different.
