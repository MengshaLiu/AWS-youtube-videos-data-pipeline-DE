It produces over twice as much thrust as the Saturn V that took humans to the moon. The goal of the test is to get further along than IFT-2 in April 20th which didn't make it to stage separation while also hoping the improvements to the launch pad hold up better than the previous attempt. If all goes well, Starship will re-enter near Hawaii about 90 minutes after it lifts off from Starbase, TX, nearly completing an orbit of the Earth. This would allow the teams to test the reentry profile and heat shields for the first time from orbital velocities. Want more information?

The company has received regulatory approval for the flight. The flight will feature the newly added hot staging ring, allowing the Ship to separate from the Booster while the Booster engines are still firing. The stack features multiple upgrades compared to the first flight, including 63 upgrades SpaceX submitted to the FAA to mitigate issues from the first flight. Ahead of the launch, SpaceX will close the road, evacuate the village and surrounding area, and clear the potential blast radius. Booster 9 will attempt a soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, while Ship 25 will attempt to fly around the earth before performing a reentry and hard splashdown in the Hawaiian area.

Our original plan was to complete a full lap of Australia and return home to Perth to resume our 'normal' lives. We decided we wanted to document our lap for the future and began sharing weekly travel vlogs of our life on the road and fell in love vlogging, filmmaking and sharing our lives with you. We completed our first lap and couldn't imagine living any other way so we decided to continue travelling and calling the Troopy home. We have gone on some crazy adventures since then and it is all thanks to you tuning in to join us every week.",Travel & Events

In Japan she is called an Okami, the head lady in charge of the restaurant, in this case a Japanese Izakaya.  This is the typical day of a Japanese night worker or a Japanese person who works all night at an all-night restaurant in Tokyo. She works at Ginza Karin, an all-night Izakaya restaurant that offers traditional home-style Japanese cuisine with a wide selection of alcohol in one the most opulent areas of Tokyo, Ginza. She built this shop from nothing and now she’s serves as the Okami.  The early-shift workers start the prep beforehand, just in time so she can check the dishes when she arrives, ensuring that each dish created meet the high quality standards she’s put in place. Her restaurant is located in the heart of the Ginza 7 chome / 8 chome district, renowned for its abundance of Japanese hostess clubs, with many of the hostesses in the area either wearing dresses or Kimonos just like Yuka. The Izakaya serves Obanzai, which are everyday Japanese side dishes made with seasonal ingredients, originating from traditional Kyoto-style home cooking.  The dishes are usually served in large bowls lined up on the shop’s countertop for customers to able to see and choose. We follow her from her morning routine all the way until the end of her work night.

(and other games sometimes too). Explaining everything there is to explain! Why is each Pokemon given the type it has? What are their origins? What is the lore of the Pokemon world and the design inspirations? And what does it all have to do with alchemy? Let's Go find out!Bonus deleted scenes for the bottom of the description!     One joke I wrote but Jeremy (rightfully) cut was Eevee finding a Waterstone, looking at it with vehement disgust, and then moving on... if you know you know.           Serperior and Quaquaval originally had a much more intense... binding moment... it was reduced to under a second for your sake... I, I really don't know what was going on with me while writing this one...You'll notice there's a semi-secret second Eevee at the end of the Eeveeloutions scene. Earlier drafts of this royale feature multiple copies of some of the starters, such as Partner Pikachu AND regular Pikachu from Yellow, or 2 different Rowlets for example, one for Sun and Moon, and one for Legends Arceus. The semi-secret second Eevee has a Katana, it's the Eevee from Conquest specifically, it was left as just a small visual gag/nod to that. Also at one point, I considered including the many starter Pokemon from Pokemon Battle Revolution too, but ultimately that would add too many Pokemon that most people would just be confused by... So we left it to the main game's Starter Pokemon.",Gaming

With a Melted VG30DETT and clean paint this was a perfect donor for a stupid engine conversion. Originally Al went down the path of bolting on a pair of G25-900's to a Nissan VH41DE 4.1L Alloy V8 but as the months went past lost interest in the project due to the complexity of the build. A few engine conversion ideas were floated around including a DCT backed Honda K24, Turbo VW VR6 or even just a stout VG30 but in the end Alan landed on the path of building a RB25/30.With the help from some epic companies like@haltechHaltech, Go Fast Bits, Raceworks, Golebys Parts and Supercheap Auto this vision is coming to life and AL's Dream 300ZX will soon be a reality!

But a lot of matter in the universe exists outside this narrow band of relatively low temperatures and pressures. Inside planets and stars, the crushing force of gravity begins to overwhelm the electromagnetic and nuclear forces that keep atoms apart and maintain the shapes of molecules. What happens next? Scientists (including a consortia of researchers at the NSF’s Center for Matter at Atomic Pressures​​) are just starting to figure that out. They use a variety of tools (including some humongous lasers) to simulate planetary cores and see what happens.
